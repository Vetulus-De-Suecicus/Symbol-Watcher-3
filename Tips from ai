Error Handling for Data Fetching
When fetching data from Yahoo Finance (yf.Ticker and .history()), add error handling for network issues, missing data, or API changes. This will make your app more robust.

Avoid Repeated Data Fetches
In convert_to_local_currency, you fetch currency data every time the function is called. Consider caching currency rates for the session or a set interval to reduce API calls and speed up the UI.

Separation of Concerns
Your Symboldata class fetches data and stores it. Consider separating data fetching (e.g., a service or utility function) from the data model to make testing and maintenance easier.

UI Responsiveness
The refresh_price method updates all labels synchronously. If you have many holdings, this could block the UI. Consider updating asynchronously or in batches.

Magic Strings and Numbers
Use constants or enums for things like "holdings.json", "SEK", and "1d". This makes the code easier to configure and maintain.

Class Naming
Use CamelCase for class names (e.g., SymbolData instead of Symboldata) to follow Python conventions.

Docstrings and Comments
Your docstrings are good, but consider adding more comments for complex logic, especially in UI composition and data conversion.

Resource Cleanup
If you open files or network connections, ensure they are properly closed or use context managers.

Unit Tests
Add unit tests for your data loading, currency conversion, and UI logic to catch bugs early.

Here are some tips to improve your code:

1. **Separate Concerns**: Split your code into multiple files/modules (e.g., data loading, UI widgets, business logic) for better maintainability.

2. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling, especially for network requests (e.g., yfinance calls) and data parsing.

3. **Avoid Global Variables**: Pass dependencies (like HOLDINGS, LOCAL_CURRENCY) as parameters or encapsulate them in classes, instead of using globals.

4. **Use Logging**: Replace print statements with the logging module for better control over output and debugging.

5. **DRY Principle**: Avoid repeating code, especially in methods like refresh_price and convert_to_local_currency. Factor out common logic.

6. **Type Annotations**: Add type hints to functions and methods for better readability and tooling support.

7. **Docstrings**: Expand docstrings to explain parameters, return values, and exceptions.

8. **UI Responsiveness**: Consider handling slow network calls asynchronously or in background threads to avoid UI freezes.

9. **Configuration**: Move settings (like PERIOD, INTERVAL, UPDATE_INTERVAL) to a config file or use environment variables.

10. **Testing**: Add unit tests for your data handling and conversion logic.

11. **Resource Management**: Cache or reuse yfinance.Ticker objects if possible, to avoid unnecessary network calls.

12. **Code Formatting**: Use a linter (like flake8) and formatter (like black) for consistent style.
